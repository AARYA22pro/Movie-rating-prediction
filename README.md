MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON


1. Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
   features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
   techniques to tackle this problem.
2. The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
   that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
   critics.
3. Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
   analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
   learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
   that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
   can estimate the ratings of movies accurately
