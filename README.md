 Build a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on
 features like genre, director, and actors. You can use regression
 techniques to tackle this problem.
 The goal is to analyze historical movie data and develop a model
 that accurately estimates the rating given to a movie by users or
 critics.
 Movie Rating Prediction project enables you to explore data
 analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine
 learning modeling techniques. It provides insights into the factors
 that influence movie ratings and allows you to build a model that
 can estimate the ratings of movies accurately
 This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the rating of Indian movies based on features like genre, director, actors, and runtime. Both regression and classification models are implemented to predict numeric ratings and classify them into categories (Low, Medium, High).
